Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?


class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        result = 0
        remaining = abs(x)
        
        if x < 0:
            return False 
        
        while remaining !=0:
            result *= 10
            result += remaining % 10
            remaining //= 10
        return x==result
